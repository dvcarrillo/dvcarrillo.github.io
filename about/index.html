<p>I am a Computer Engineer from Granada, Spain, specialized in Software
Engineering. In 2018, I obtained my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree at the <a href="http://www.ugr.es">University
of Granada</a>, but I have also studied for one year at
<a href="http://www.lut.fi">Lappeenranta University of Technology</a>, in Finland.
I am mainly interested in the field of Human Computer Interaction and in
the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

<p>I remember being passionate for technology since I was a little child,
exploring every aspect of the old computer my family had. At the age of
12, I started creating websites and blogs, where I usually wrote about
everything new I learned about technology. Some of them are still online,
being <a href="http://apuntuxold.blogspot.com">Apuntux</a> one of the most popular.
Years after, I wrote some more posts in a
<a href="http://apuntux.blogspot.com">newer version</a> of this previous blog.</p>

<p>My first contact with Linux was at the age of 10, and a year later I
started installing different Linux <em>distros</em> on the old family computer.
Yes, I broke it once trying to install Gentoo without any manual&hellip;</p>

<p>All this could only have one possible end: to study Computer Engineering, so I applied for the univeristy of my hometown, which in fact is among the
<a href="https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/ciencia/2017-08-18/granada-ingenieria-informatica_1430045/">32 best in the world</a>.
I created my <a href="https://github.com/dvcarrillo">GitHub account</a> shortly
after I entered college and I started uploading my projects as soon as I
could. In the university, as well as by myself, I have worked with a wide
range of programming languages and technologies, including C, C++, Java,
Python and Ruby.</p>

<p>Apart from technology, I also love <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidvargas996/">photography</a>,
the arts and, above all, travelling and discovering new cultures. This is
why I studied one year abroad in Lappeenranta, Finland. Later on, I did a
volunteering experience in Hungary, thanks to the Erasmus program as
well. Nowadays, I can&rsquo;t wait to live new adventures all around the world!</p>
